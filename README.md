What is pinboard?
===================

Pinboard is a bookmark website. In stead of bookmarking on your own computer in the browser you can use pinboard. The service is very minimalistic and privacy focused. I use it all the time to put articles on my reading list, to archive tweets and to collect material for my secondary blog and for this blog.

The related scripts are attached on this repository to follow.
